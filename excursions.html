	      <h5>Price: 10€</h5>
	      <p>The Modane Underground Laboratory (LSM) is the deepest European particle physics laboratory, located within the Fréjus tunnel linking Italy and France. We’ll first visit the main building and the control rooms in the city of Modane and then we’ll have the exclusive opportunity to enter the underground facility that hosts the Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory (NEMO), one of the most sensitive neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments in the world.</p>
	      <p>In the afternoon we’ll have the chance to relax among the Italian Alps, enjoying a fresh trekking excursion within centuries-old forests, in full contact with nature and history. Participants are recommended to wear comfortable shoes, suitable clothes and waterproof garments in case of unexpected rain.</p>

	      <h5>Price: 10€</h5>
	      <p>The National Centre of Oncology Hadrontherapy (CNAO) in Pavia is one of the four medical centres in the world specifically dedicated to the treatment of cancer through hadrontherapy. Here, protons and carbon ions are accelerated by a 25m diameter synchrotron to several hundredths of MeV and then shot on tumours up to 27cm deep in the body. We’ll have the chance to visit a cutting-edge facility and get in touch with the most advanced challenges of medical physics.</p>

	      <p>During the travel, we’ll stop in Canelli, in the Langhe area, and visit one of its historical wine cellars, part of the so-called “Underground cathedrals”. This geographical area has been declared a UNESCO world heritage site and it’s the home of some of the most important Italian wines. We’ll have the chance to get to know the secrets of the art of wine-making, as well as taste these exceptional products of the Italian tradition.</p>
