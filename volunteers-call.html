      <h1>Call for ICPS Volunteers</h1>

      <p>The International Conference of Physics Students (ICPS), to be held in Torino in August 2017, will be a unique opportunity for Italy to display its best scientific research, an excellent framework to work and study, as well as to host professional events. The Italian Association of Physics Students (AISF) and the ICPS2017 Organizing Committee in particular, wish to make the most of this opportunity with a strong team of volunteers who will cover every organizational aspect of the event. </p>

      <p>Approximately 50 volunteers will be recruited from the entire country. About half of these will be from the AISF Local Committee of Torino, which will host the event and will thus cover a significant part of the workload. All applicants for volunteering roles should fulfill the following criteria:</p>
      <ul class="bigul">
	<li>They must be Physics students in a bachelor, master or PhD programme, in Italy or abroad. We will accept applications from anyone who completed or is expecting to complete his/her studies in Physics after August 2016.</li>
	<li>They must be able to demonstrate suitable proficiency in English, both written and spoken. Proficiency will be tested upon an interview with members of the Volunteers Selection Committee.</li>
	<li>They must be available in Torino for the entire time period of the Conference, starting at least three days before the opening date and ending at least one day after the closing date. Some volunteers will be needed also in the days immediately preceding the Conference in order to support the IAPS Delegates days.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Moreover, the following will be taken to support volunteers’ applications:</p>

	<li>Previous participation in any IAPS events, whether directly organized by AISF for the IAPS community or by other National Committees.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All successful applicants will be granted a position on the volunteering board of ICPS2017 and will be exempted from the €180 application fee to attend the conference.
