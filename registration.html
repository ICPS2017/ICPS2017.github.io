      <h1>Registration</h1>
      <p>Registration will open on this page on February 5th at 13.00 CET.</p>      
      <p>Please read the terms and conditions below. Note that, upon registration, you will be asked for personal details (such as name, surname, date of birth, university affiliation, passport number etc.). You will also be asked to place in order of preference the excursions that are on offer during the Conference; the Organizing Committee will assign students to one excursion only, attempting to satisfy all requests as best as it can. </p>      
      <p>We encourage students to present personal scientific work, either in the form of a poster or a talk. For those that wish to do so, it is required to upload an abstract during the registration process. If this is not available at the time of registration, it is possible to UPLOAD IT SOMEWHERE. Please find more information HERE.</p>
      <p>For any question about the registration process, please write to <a href="mailto:icps2017registration@ai-sf.it">icps2017registration@ai-sf.it</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>Deadline for registration and payment </h3>      
      <p>A first round of registration for the event will open at this page between February 5th (13:00, CET) and February 26th (13:00, CET). During this early registration period, a fee of €190 will apply. Participants are strongly encouraged to submit an abstract for
a short seminar or a poster.</p>
      <p>Registration will open again between March 12th (13:00, CET) and April 20th (13:00, CET), when a fee of €220 will apply.<p>
      <p>Note that these costs (which are reduced in the early phase to facilitate participation of long-time ICPS supporters) include the value of accommodation, standard food and drink, organized travel during the Conference, gadgets and the use of academic facilities and materials. Heavy subsidization is provided by our sponsors, both institutional and private-sector ones.</p>
      <p>Following a registration, participants will receive instructions by email on how to proceed to make the required fee payment. A maximum of 5 days is allowed between filling the early-registration form and the presentation by email (or in other form) of a proof-of-payment to <a href="mailto:icps2017registration@ai-sf.it">icps2017registration@ai-sf.it</a>. Payments will be accepted by:
	<ul class="bigul">
	  <li>bank transfer (details will be provided upon registration). Please note that any extra-fee or exchange rate applied by the bank must be paid by the applicant and <em>not</em> be charged to the recipient.</li>
	  <li>credit card (service operated by <a href="https://stripe.com">stripe</a>). Please note that the <a href="https://stripe.com/it/pricing">service fee</a> will be charged to the applicant.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>Early-registrations will be capped at 20 students per nation, with the exception of Italian students (only 10 to be admitted during this first phase). Once these limits will be reached, no more students from a certain country will be allowed to register until the second phase will be open. A maximum of 40 students per nation will be accepted over the two expected phases of registration; such limitations will be removed in June in case more applications will be made possible. Only a total of 30 Italian students will be accepted over the two phases of registration (10 in the early one, 20 in the second); this is to reflect the fact that a body of 40 Italian students will already be members of the Organizing Committee and the group of ICPS volunteers.</p>
      <p>In order to participate in the ICPS, the applicants must be IAPS members. At the end of the early-registration round, an affiliation check will be carried out and the applicants that do not comply with this requirement will be rejected. Reimbursement of the fee will be provided according to the specifications below.</p>
      <p>During the second phase of registration (March 12th - April 20th), the Organizers will give preference to students who have submitted an application to present scientific work, either in the form of a poster or a talk. Abstracts will be reviewed by the first week of May and participants will receive confirmation of whether they will be able to present their work in the following days. Note that it is not required for ICPS participants to submit an abstract.</p>
      <p>National Committees are responsible for confirming the membership of ICPS applicants to the Organizers, following communication from the latter of the appropriate data provided upon registration.</p>
