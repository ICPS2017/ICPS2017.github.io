      <h3>Deadline for registration and payment</h3>      
      <p>A first round of registration for the event is open on this page between February 5th (12:00, CET) and February 26th (12:00, CET). During this early registration period, a fee of €190 will apply. Participants are strongly encouraged to submit an abstract for
a short seminar or a poster.</p>
            <p>Registration will open again between March 12th (12:00, CET) and April 20th (12:00, CET), when a fee of €220 will apply.<p>
      <p>Note that these costs (which are reduced in the early phase to facilitate participation of long-time ICPS supporters) include the value of accommodation, standard food and drink, organized travel during the Conference, gadgets and the use of academic facilities and materials. Heavy subsidization is provided by our sponsors, both institutional and private-sector ones.</p>
      <p>After the closing of each registration round, a selection process will take place. Early-registrations will be capped at 20 students per nation, with the exception of Italian students (only 10 to be admitted during this first phase). If these limits are reached in the selection process, the other applicants will be put in a waiting list. People from the waiting list can be accepted to the conference in case other applicants fail to meet the conditions or the application (e.g. payment not received, wrong affiliation stated), or in the case places in the conference are still available after the closing of late registration. 
	      All the applicants in waiting list will be eligible to pay the early registration fee and will be provided with the payment information as soon as they are accepted. A maximum of 30 students per nation will be accepted over the two expected phases of registration; such limitations will be removed in June in case more applications are possible.</p>
      <p>At the end of each selection, the participants will be notified via email about their status. The selected participants will receive instructions by email on how to proceed to make the required fee payment. The payment should be received by the Organising Committee in a maximum of 7 days, starting from the day the acceptance email is sent. A proof of payment should be send by email (or other form) to the OC at <a href="mailto:icps2017registration@ai-sf.it">icps2017registration@ai-sf.it</a> as soon as possible, in order to handle possible delays in the payment. Payments will be accepted by:
	<ul class="bigul">
	  <li>bank transfer (details will be provided upon registration). Please note that any extra-fee or exchange rate applied by the bank must be paid by the applicant and <em>not</em> be charged to the recipient.</li>
	  <li>credit card (service operated by <a href="https://stripe.com">stripe</a>). Please note that the <a href="https://stripe.com/it/pricing">service fee</a> will be charged to the applicant.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>In order to participate in the ICPS, the applicants must be IAPS members. At the end of the early-registration round, an affiliation check will be carried out and the applicants that do not comply with this requirement will be rejected. Reimbursement of the fee will be provided according to the specifications below.</p>
      <p>During both the registration phases (Early registration from the 5th to the 26th of February, late registration from the 12th of March to the 20th of April), the Organizers will give preference to students who have submitted an application to present scientific work, either in the form of a poster or a talk. Abstracts will be reviewed by the first week of May and participants will receive confirmation of whether they will be able to present their work in the following days. Note that it is not required for ICPS participants to submit an abstract.</p>
      <p>National Committees are responsible for confirming the membership of ICPS applicants to the Organizers, following communication from the latter of the appropriate data provided upon registration.</p>
