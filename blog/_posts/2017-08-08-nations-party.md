The Nations Party is your occasion to prepare a typical recipe of your
country and get a taste of international cuisine from all over the
world. Each National Committee has the possibility to use one of the
kitchens in the residence and propose a speciality of the house. We
encourage National Committees to coordinate the preparation of their
dishes in advance. Kitchenware will be provided by the Organizing
Committee.
