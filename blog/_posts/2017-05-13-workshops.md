### Web workshop COMSOL

An interactive web workshop in multiphysics simulation. During
the first session, you will see the capabilities and workflow of the
COMSOL Multiphysics® software. The second session will be focused on
High-Frequency Electromagnetics modeling.

You will leave with new skills to work on your own applications using
your free two-week COMSOL Multiphysics® trial.

We recommend you to install your free two-week trial license of the
COMSOL Multiphysics® software right away and to bring your laptop to
the event, in order to get the most out of it. Unable to bring a
laptop to the workshop? No worries; you can still follow along with
the demonstrations.

During this web workshop, we will discuss:

#### Intro to COMSOL Multiphysics®
<ul class="bigul">
    <li>Get an introduction to the capabilities and the fundamental modeling workflow of COMSOL Multiphysics®</li>
    <li>Watch a live presentation of the entire analysis process via a practical example</li>
    <li>See how quick and easy it is to turn your sophisticated model
	into a specialized application that any engineer can use</li>
</ul>

#### Modeling High-Frequency Electromagnetics
<ul class="bigul">
    <li>Modeling techniques applicable to antennas, waveguides, cavities, and filters</li>
    <li>Microwave and laser heating</li>
    <li>Photonics, plasmonics, and metamaterials</li>
    <li>Ray tracing through optical systems</li>
</ul>
