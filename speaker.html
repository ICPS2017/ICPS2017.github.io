                  <p>Francesco Tombesi is an astrophysicist at NASA/GSFC and assistant research scientist at the Department of Astronomy of the University of Maryland, College Park. His main research topic is the study of super-massive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) through X-ray observations collected from orbiting satellites. In particular, he investigates the origin of black hole driven winds, such as the powerful ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), and their feedback on the AGN host galaxies. Dr. Tombesi is a member of the science teams of the upcoming large X-ray observatories ASTRO-H (launch date February 2016) and Athena (launch date in 2028). He has been awarded several prizes, among which the 2014 "Early Career Research Scientist Prize for Excellence” of the Dept. of Astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park and the “2014 NASA Astrophysics Science Division Peer Award”.</p>

                  <p>Francesco Prino is presently a researcher of the INFN Torino. He got his PhD in 2001 with a thesis on the analysis of the data collected in 1998 by the NA50 experiment. In November 2002 he got a permanent research position at INFN in Turin. From 2004 he worked mainly on the preparation, the commissioning and the data analysis of the ALICE experiment at the LHC. Within the ALICE experiment he worked on the construction, test and performance studies of the silicon drift detectors (SDD) of the inner tracking system (ITS). He is, since October 2008, the project leader of the SDD detector. He worked on the analysis of the data collected by the ALICE experiment to study the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is the state of nuclear matter at extremely high temperature and densities, such as those of the early universe few microseconds after the Big Bang. In the laboratory, the QGP is created by colliding heavy nuclei at large energies. In particular, Francesco Prino contributed to the quest of the QGP by studying the production of particles with charm quarks (D mesons in ALICE and J/psi in NA50) which are particularly sensitive probes of the properties of the QGP. He has been the convener of the Heavy-Flavour working groups of the ALICE collaboration from January 2013 to December 2014 and he is presently serving as deputy coordinator of the Data Preparation Group of the ALICE experiment. He presented his research activities on NA50 and ALICE experiments as well as on the silicon detectors in various international conferences. He has been co-supervisor of 7 master degree theses and 2 PhD thesis. </p>

			<p>Roberto Vittori graduated from the Italian <i>Accademia Aeronautica</i> in 1989 and then trained as a pilot in the United States. In 1998, Vittori was selected by the ESA to join the European Astronaut Corps. He participated in several spaceflights with the Russian Soyuz and he took part in the penultimate mission of the American Space Shuttle Program. 
			He was the first European astronaut to visit the International Space Station (ISS) twice. He carried out numerous experiments in astrobiology and space physiology. He was the last non-American to fly aboard the Space Shuttle. He was decorated by Italy and Russia and he is a high-ranking officer of the Italian Air Force.</p>
