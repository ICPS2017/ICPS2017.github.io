      <h3>Deadline for registration and payment </h3>      
      <p> A first round of registration for the event will be open at this page between February 5th (13:00, CET) and February 26th (13:00, CET). During this early registration period, a fee of €190 will apply.</p>
      <p>Registration will open again between March 12th (13:00, CET) and April 20th (13:00, CET), when a fee of €220 will apply.<p>
      <p>Note that these costs (which are reduced in the early phase to facilitate participation of long-time ICPS supporters) include the value of accommodation, standard food and drink, organized travel during the Conference, gadgets and the use of academic facilities and materials. There is no additional fee for excursions. Heavy subsidization is provided by our sponsors, both institutional and private-sector ones.</p>
      <p>Following a registration, participants will receive instructions by email on how to proceed to make the required fee payment. A maximum of 5 days is allowed between filling the early-registration form and the presentation by email (or in other form) of a proof-of-payment to <a href="mailto:icps2017registration@ai-sf.it">icps2017registration@ai-sf.it</a>. Payments will be accepted by bank transfer (details will be provided upon registration) or <a href="https://stripe.com">stripe</a>.</p>
      <p>Early-registrations will be capped at 20 students per nation, with the exception of Italian students (only 10 to be admitted during this first phase). Once these limits will be reached, no more students from a certain country will be allowed to register until the second phase will be open. A maximum of 40 students per nation will be accepted over the two expected phases of registration; such limitations will be removed in June in case more applications will be made possible. Only a total of 30 Italian students will be accepted over the two phases of registration (10 in the early one, 20 in the second); this is to reflect the fact that a body of 40 Italian students will already be members of the Organizing Committee and the group of ICPS volunteers.</p>   
      <p>During the second phase of registration (March 12th - April 20th), the Organizers will give preference to students who have submitted an application to present scientific work, either in the form of a poster or a talk. Abstracts will be reviewed by the first week of May and participants will receive confirmation of whether they will be able to present their work in the following days. Note that it is not required for ICPS participants to submit an abstract.</p>
      <p>National Committees are responsible for confirming the membership of ICPS applicants to the Organizers, following communication from the latter of the appropriate data provided upon registration.</p>
