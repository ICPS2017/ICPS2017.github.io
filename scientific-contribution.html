      <h1>Scientific Contributions</h1>
      <p>Did you just find a new exciting result and you can't wait to discuss it with other young researchers? Can you communicate your research topic in an accessible and innovative way? Are you a young student with some physics related interest which could entertain your fellows? Then ICPS is the right place for you. Here all presentations are welcome: from your summer school up to your PhD project.</p>
      <p><a href="/registration">When you register</a>, you can choose whether to give a talk or present a poster. You will be asked to submit an abstract and you will be able to modify it until the last available day for the registration (February 28th for early birds and April 20th for late registrants). Remember that an active role in the conference gives you priority in the selection of the participants and increases your chances of attending ICPS 2017! Therefore donâ€™t be shy and prove yourself with a public talk or with a poster.</p>
      <p>The abstracts will be evaluated by a scientific committee, presided by Lorenzo Bianchi, postdoc at Hamburg University, and Lucio Milanese, graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We expect to divide the topics of the presentations in four main categories:
	<ul class="bigul">
	  <li>Theoretical and pedagogical: includes all the talks and posters concerning a specific topic of interest for the research in theoretical physics or, more generally, devoted to the pedagogical (and possibly entertaining) introduction of some textbook topics.</li>
	  <li>Experimental: includes talks and posters reporting on some recent experimental results or describing some experimental setup of interest for fundamental research.</li>
	  <li>Applied: includes talks and posters dealing with applications of physics outside the fundamental research. This ranges from daily life applications of classical physics to frontier quantum technologies.</li>
	  <li>Other: whatever comes to your mind which does not fit in the previous categories, but you find amazing.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>We are looking forward to listening to a lot of exciting presentations and seeing many wonderful posters.</p>
